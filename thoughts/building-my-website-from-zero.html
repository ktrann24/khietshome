                    <blockquote>Confucius said: <em><strong>“I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”</strong></em></blockquote>

                    <p>I’ve been wrapping up my 2025 annual planning and one theme kept popping up: wanting to get more hands-on with modern AI tools, especially Cursor and Claude Code.</p>

                    <p>I love Notion, and it’s still where I do most of my thinking and writing. But I also wanted to understand how these tools can work together.</p>

                    <p>I don't write code for a living. What really matters in my job is using the tools at my disposal to solve problems.</p>

                    <p>So I made it simple. No grand plan. No overthinking. I pulled up Cursor and built a personal website.</p>

                    <h3><strong>The First Prompt</strong></h3>

                    <p>On December 26, I prompted: “build me a custom website landing page.”</p>

                    <figure><img src="images/building-my-website-from-zero-01a74be49e04.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

                    <p>A full site showed up: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, dark mode, animations. A few hours later, <a href="http://trankhiet.com/">trankhiet.com</a> was live.</p>

                    <p>With a limited development background, it was a genuinely mind-blowing jump: a single prompt → a real website on the internet.</p>

                    <h3><strong>AI Gives You Capability. Taste Makes It Yours.</strong></h3>

                    <p>AI makes shipping fast. Taste is what makes it good.</p>

                    <p>Cursor gave me a strong foundation instantly. But everything that made it feel like <em>mine</em> came after: accent colors, typography, spacing, and the small personal touches that walk the line between tasteful and too much.</p>

                    <p>At one point I considered adding a more visual, animated experience. Then I realized I’m not trying to ship a flashy visual portfolio. I’m building a clean place to write and publish. Simple is the point.</p>

                    <figure><img src="images/building-my-website-from-zero-752ff303fc79.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

                    <p>Software design is still unexplored territory for me. I don’t know the rules, the principles, or the best practices. But this project gave me a deeper respect for the designers, engineers, and product managers who do.</p>

                    <p>There’s real craft in making something feel right. In knowing when to add, when to remove, and when to nudge a single pixel. AI can write code, but it can’t tell you what feels like you.</p>

                    <p>If anyone can generate an app, taste becomes the differentiator.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Getting Hands On With Notion’s API</strong></h3>

                    <p>Once the site felt right visually, the next design question wasn’t about pixels. It was about process. Where should the writing live, and how could publishing feel just as intentional as the site itself?</p>

                    <p>In the first iteration I planned to write my content where I already spend the most time today, Notion. Then the plan would be to turn the post into HTML and push the code to the website. This worked, but was it the best way?</p>

                    <p>One of my favorite moments in this process was asking Cursor a simple question: “How can I make this process better?”</p>

                    <figure><img src="images/building-my-website-from-zero-a97cd8e4030a.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

                    <p>The suggestion clicked immediately: if my writing already lives in Notion, why not let Notion be the source of truth?</p>

                    <p>That meant using <a href="https://developers.notion.com/">Notion’s API</a> to treat Notion as my CMS, pull published posts, and convert Notion blocks into HTML. </p>

                    <p>     With Cursor’s help, I wrote a script that:</p>

                    <h3><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h3>

                    <p>Now I have a clean place to share my thoughts, and a project that taught me a lot by forcing me to build.</p>

                    <p>Tinkering is ridiculously fun, taste and judgement matter more than ever, and AI has democratized technical ability. This means the bar will be higher than ever, and the rising bar is exactly what makes the future exciting.</p>
